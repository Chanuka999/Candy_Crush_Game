# Candy_Crush_Game
A classic tile-matching puzzle game inspired by the popular Candy Crush. In this game, players swap adjacent candies to create rows or columns of three or more matching candies. When a match is made, the candies disappear, and new ones fall into place, creating opportunities for chain reactions and high scores.
